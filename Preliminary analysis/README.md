## Preliminary analysis

In this folder, you will find detailed entropy results of the analysis that helped us 
shape our canvas authentication mechanism. For each phase, you can also find the complete
source code in the **code** folder. Each test is clearly delimited in each script.

You can run each of these tests on the following dedicated webpage 
[HERE](https://plaperdr.github.io/morellian-canvas/Preliminary%20analysis/webpage/canvas.html).
