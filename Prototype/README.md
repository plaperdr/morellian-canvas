## Prototype

In the **code** folder, you can find the raw code of our canvas mechanism.
In the **webpage** folder, you can find a standalone version that will show you 
a canvas challenge along with the corresponding canvas image. 
This page also reports the generation, rendering and hashing times.
You can see this demo in action 
[HERE](https://plaperdr.github.io/morellian-canvas/Prototype/webpage/picassauth.html).
